This project uses XGBoost Regressor to predict housing prices in California based on data from the California Housing Dataset. The dataset includes various features like median income, house age, number of rooms, and location (latitude and longitude) to predict the median house value.

Key Features:

1. Correlation Analysis: A heatmap to show the relationships between features.
2. Data Visualization: Distribution of housing prices and scatter plots to compare actual vs predicted values.
3. Model Training: The XGBoost model is trained on 80% of the data and tested on the remaining 20%.

Performance Evaluation:

1. R² Score: Shows how well the model fits the data.
2. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Average error between predicted and actual prices.

Results:

1. The model gives an R² score of X.XX on training data and X.XX on test data.
2. The predictions are visualized with a scatter plot comparing actual vs predicted prices.
